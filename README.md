## Project Description

This project involves classifying images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is used to automatically extract features from the images, followed by fully connected layers to make predictions.

- **Dataset**: The project uses a labeled dataset of cat and dog images. 
- **Model Architecture**: The CNN is built using **Keras** on top of **TensorFlow** with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers for final classification.
- **Training**: The model is trained using the **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss** function, with data augmentation to prevent overfitting.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the project.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for building and training the CNN model.
- **Keras**: High-level API for fast prototyping of deep learning models.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing model training and validation performance.
